    <br>
    <br>
    <p align="center"> Since starting 5-2 and their only losses being to the Nuggets and the Jazz by a total of 2 points, the Suns have slowed down just a bit. This does not mean, however, that they have not been 
one of the most fun teams to watch. Watching the suns in the 2018-2019 season was a struggle, seeing Devin Booker take every shot- and that is not a knock on the kid, that is what he had to do-it was simply unbearable. This year is a completly different story. I have watched more Phoenix Suns games than I have watched Lakers games, than I have watched Sixers games; this team is just interesting. A huge part of their newfound success is the new system and culture that Monty Williams brought with him. His system is not built to out basketball other teams; of course Devin Booker is going to get his, Kelly Oubre is going to get his, but those 23 ppg and 19 ppg (respectivley) has not been what has kept the Suns afloat. Actually that is not even close to what stands out about this team, it is their tenacity, it's their desire to turn the organization around.
