    <br>
    <br>
    <p align="center"> Since starting 5-2 and their only losses being to the Nuggets and the Jazz by a total of 2 points,</br> the Suns have slowed down just a bit. This does not mean, however, that they have not been one </br>of the most fun teams to watch. Watching the suns in the 2018-2019 season was a struggle, </br>seeing Devin Booker take every shot- and that is not a knock on the kid, that is what he had to do-it</br> was simply unbearable. This year is a completly different story. I have watched more Phoenix Suns games than I</br> have watched Lakers games, than I have watched Sixers games; this team is just interesting. A huge part of<br> their newfound success is the new system and culture that Monty Williams brought with him. His system is not<br> built to out basketball other teams; of course Devin Booker is going to get his, Kelly Oubre <br>is going to get his, but those 23 ppg and 19 ppg (respectivley) has not been what has kept<br> the Suns afloat. Actually that is not even close to what stands out about this team, it is<br> their tenacity, it's their desire to turn the organization around.
