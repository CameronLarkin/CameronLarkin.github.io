    <h1 align="center"id="early">Early Season Success</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p align="Center"> 	<span class="first-word">The</span> Suns are fun to watch again! And it isn't even a joke. I have watched more Phoenix Suns games than I have 76er games, than I have watched Clippers games, than I have watched Lakers games. This team brings in ratings to the league.<br><br> <span class="first-word">In</span> a time where there is so much speculation about who is going to make the finals, or who is going to win MVP, the Suns have been in a small spotlight with their hot start to the season. Compared to last seasons 4-20 start, they are already 11-13 in their first 24 contests. A special thing about their 11-13 is that they have lost 10 games by less than 10 points. The importance of this stat shows when looking at the pace of the league an how quickly 10 points can be scored. All that to say that if the suns had maybe 2-3 more minutes in each of those 10 games they could realistically be sitting at 21-3.<br><br> <span class="first-word">Now</span> obviously they are not going to pull out every single one of those games out, so we will call it an even 16-8 (5 and 5 split). With a record like that, a team that finished last year 21-61, would be sitting at the 4th or 5th seed in the western conference. Needless to say the Suns organization made a plethera of great offseason moves to make this early season success a reality, and what should really excite Suns fans is the fact that their team may actually be looking on the upside for the first time in a very, very long time.

<ul id="list">
    	1) Monty Williams
    
</ul>
<p align="left">
<span class="first-word">The</span> coach doesn't matter! They get paid to sub players in and out! You don't need a good coach to be a great team! And to those I say... Just sit down and be quiet!<br><br> <span class="first-word">How</span> can someone sit there and tell me that the fact that the Suns have had <em>SIX</em> coaches in <em>FIVE</em> years has not affected their team in the win collumn. Monty Williams has already led the Suns to their best start in 6 years. The man simply has a winning formula. His defensive mind is something that the Suns desperatley needed; before Williams arrived in Phoenix, Devin Booker was bottom 20% in defensive efficency in eavh of his first five seasons. Monty Williams has found a way to will an offensive minded star to guard the opposing team's best player night in and night out.<br><br> <span class="first-word">The</span> respect that the new Suns coach has garnered around the league is a testement to his supreme smarts and gameplan. In years past the suns have had a mentality that if the other team scores, they will just have to find a way to score on their possesion too. Monty has taught these young players if they get more stops than the other team, then their offense will speak for itself. Regardless of how the season ends for the Suns, the future is looking bright, and whoever it was in the Suns front office that suggested hiring Monty Williams should get an enormous raise. He is by far the best staff signing that happened this offseason.

    2) Ricky Rubio
    
    </ul>
<p align="left">
Most fans look at ol' Ricky Rubio and immediatly look at the negatives, ie. he can't shoot or he can't defend. Now in years past these facts about Rubio have been what has been holding him back. With the Phoenix Suns The Spanish guard gets to do what he does best, distribute the ball. Distribute the rock to teamates who are primary scorers such as Devin and Kelly.<br><br> Now Ricky Rubio's scoring is nothing to just skip over. The man averages a solid 14 ppg. Players such as <em>Al Horford</em> (a former allstar), <em>Mike</em> Conly (a borderline allstar), <em>Rudy Gobert</em> (widley respected as one of the best centers in the league), <em>Aaron Gordon</em> (a rising star) all average about 14 ppg. The Suns don't even need Rubio to be one of their main scorers, but he continues to be their thrid option in this years games.<br><br>
It is pointless to sit here and try to state Ricky Rubio's improtance to the Suns organization, rather to tell fans to watch him play and watch how many open teamates he finnds with his superior court vision.

    3) Aron Baynes
    
    </ul>
    
    <p align="left">
    
    <span class="first-word">It</span> is actually really easy to talk about what Aron Baynes brings to the team. He brings a big body, a shot blocker, and a pick and roll man. Right? That's all he is right? Just your typical NBA center? <strong>WRONG!</strong> That was him last year with the Boston Celtics. The new and improved Aron Baynes might very well be a top 12 center in this league.<br><br> <span class="first-word">His</span> impact is comparable to Steven Adams with Russell Westbrook, but Aron can score the ball more. He does set some of the hardest screens in the NBA, but he also rolls to the basket harder than any center this season. He moves off the ball to allow an open lane for his main scorers, he has the ability to space the floor... <strong>AND</strong> he has one of the most team friendly contracts in the league.

    	<p align="left">
        <span class="first-word">A</span> winning culture might finally be in the city of Phoenix, and it is about dang time. With at 11-13 start they have accumulated their best start of Devin Booker's career. The front office might actually be onto something with the moves they have recently made. Devin Booker may finally have help.<br><br><span class="first-word">James</span> Jones is starring in his role as the organizations GM. The Suns in recent history have been a train wreck, the laughing stock of the league. But as of the year 2019 they have become competitive again, and they might soon be back to the success that the 7 second or less Phoenix Suns had.
