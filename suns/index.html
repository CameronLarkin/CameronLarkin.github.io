    <p align="left"> The Suns are fun to watch again! And it isn't even a joke. I have watched more Phoenix Suns games than I have 76er games, than I have watched Clippers games, than I have watched Lakers games. This team brings in ratings to the league. In a time where there is so much speculation about who is going to make the finals, or who is going to win MVP, the Suns have been in a small spotlight with their hot start to the season. Compared to last seasons 4-20 start, they are already 11-13 in their first 24 contests. A special thing about their 11-13 is that they have lost 10 games by less than 10 points. The importance of this stat shows when looking at the pace of the league an how quickly 10 points can be scored, all that to say that if the suns had maybe 2-3 more minutes in each of those 10 games they could realistically be sitting at 21-3. Now obviously they are not going to puul out every single one of those games out, so we will call it an even 16-8 (5 and 5 split). With a record like that, a team that finished last year 21-61, would be sitting at the 4th or 5th seed in the western conference. Needless to say the Suns organization made a plethera of great offseason moves to make this early season success a reality, and what should really excite Suns fans is the fact that their team may actually be looking on the upside for the first time in a very, very long time((((((((((((
