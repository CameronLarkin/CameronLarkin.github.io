    <h2>New European in Dallas</h2>
    
    <p> Luka Doncic is on a complete and utter tear right now! I mean the kid is nothing short of pheonominal. In seven games this season he has lead his team to a 5-2 record, placing them at the second seed in the western conference; this puts them above teams like the Clippers, Rockets, and Blazers. While averaging 26.7 ppg, 9.9 rpg, and 9.1 asg, Luka obviously fills the stat sheet for the Mavs night in and night out; what fans at home do not notice is his impact outside of the core stats of the game. The 20 year olds career +/- is +24. When Luka Doncic is on the floor for the Mavs, they outscore their opponents by 24. Not many players in this beautiful league of ours can be that impactful to their teams, and Luka is the Sole impactor for his team.</p>
    
    <h2>Mavs red hot start</h2>
    
    <p>Last year the Mavs finished in 14th place in the tough western confernce, bad but not the worst. The real down side was the fact that they finished with the 6th worst record in the league in front of the Wizards, Hawks, Bulls, Cavs, Knicks, and the Suns. This year is looking like it is going to be a different story. This new look Mavs team is interesting, in a good way. With the addition of all star PF in Kristaps Porzingis they now have their replacement for Dirk; not to mention the aquesitions of Raptors pg Delon Wright, and Blazers sg Seth curry. This Mavs team is built around Luka to a T. Shooters everywhere, slashers everywhere, and options to throw a lob to...Everywhere. I mean their centers are all 7 foot 1 and up. Starting out 5-2 is a blessing for any team, especially for one that has some new pieces. Losing to the Lakers is understandable, I mean LeBron put up an unearthly statline, and Luka looked like he did not know his name after meeting Dwight Howards elbow. Their other loss was handed to them By the Blazers, carried by a 35 point performance from Cj, oh and did I mention they only lost by 2. The dogs out in Dallas have looked scary to start the season, and (to me) they are the most fun team in basketball to watch.</p>
        
    <h2>Can they keep it up</h2>
    <p>With my whole heartI believe that the Dallas Mavericks can keep this up all season long. starting with a 5-2 record puts this team on track for 61 wins. Now I know that projections do not always come to fruition, but i can see this team tallying their wins into the 50s. Maybe 54-28. I believe in this team and I believe in whatever Rick Carlisle has planned. Luka is a premire player in this league, and he is not even legally allowed to drink alchohol. Let that sink in. A <em>Kid</em> is, for lack of a better word, balling right now, and the kid is young enouch to where he does not need load management. The child can go all season long playing the highest callibar of basketball. Alongside Kristaps Porzingis, Luck will, mark my words, lead this team back to the promise lands.</p>
