    <p><img src="https://theundefeated.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nbalogo.jpg?w=700" width="100" length="300"> Luka Doncic is on a complete and utter tear right now! I mean the kid is nothing short of pheonominal. In seven games this season he has lead <strong>his</strong>team to a 5-2 record, placing them at the second seed in the western conference; this puts them above teams like the Clippers, Rockets, and Blazers. While averaging 26.7 ppg, 9.9 rpg, and 9.1 asg, Luka obviously fills the stat sheet for the Mavs night in and night out; what fans at home do not notice is his impact outside of the core stats of the game. The 20 year olds career +/- is +24. When Luka Doncic is on the floor for the Mavs, they outscore their opponents by 24. Not many players in this beautiful league of ours can be that impactful to their teams, and Luka is the Sole impactor for his team.</p>
